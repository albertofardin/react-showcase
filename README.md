There’s no better résumé for a developer than their own code.

This project is my personal online portfolio.
It also includes a customizable component library designed to help build faster and more accessible applications, following the [Material Design](https://material.io/design/introduction/) guidelines.

Built with [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/).
